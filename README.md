## About the Project
The aim of this project is to link routinely collected health and social care data for Liverpool in order to better understand who is using IC, what is being delivered as IC (and to whom), and if it possible to detect any impact of IC on patient outcomes.
- Objective 1. Establish linkage between health (NHS) and social care (local authority) datasets and use this to identify individuals on alternative pathways of care.
- Objective 2. Describe and explore the demographic and health characteristics of people on the alternative pathways of care.
- Objective 3. Describe different forms of IC services received and explore how the intensity of support received is related to individual level of need.
- Objective 4. Compare the characteristics of patients receiving home-based or bed-based IC support and those without an assigned pathway.
- Objective 5. Explore the impact of IC by comparing the health outcomes of those who received it with (clinically/demographically) similar people who did not receive it.
